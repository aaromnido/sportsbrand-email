# sportsbrand-email

## Introduction
Along with my career as a UX/UI designer and Front Developer, I didn't take the opportunity to go deep in Email Front Dev.  Trying to fill this gap and not reinvent the wheel, I started this pet project as a testing way to learn over "giants shoulders" as ZURB Foundation is.

## Project description
For this learning project  I'm going to create something almost real. A marketing newsletter for a hypothetical sports products brand ("atiras." ;-) ), including the typical things:

- Header with logo and navigation menu.
- Products in some columns with, title, description, and photos.
- One or some Call to action buttons.
- Social buttons.
- Footer with copyright and some links
